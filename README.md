# FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT WITH PYTHON- TECHWAVE 
Hi we made this project during Full Stack development with Python Training program, conducted by <b> TechWave </b>.

## About the project :
This project is a simple url shortener. There is a sign in page. If not authorized shows '404 page not found error page'. After authorizing, it takes url 
from the webpage viewer and shortens it. There is a random generation of upto 6 characters(alphabet and numeric values). There is also a copy button to copy the new generated url. Original url, shortened url, number of visits on webpage and date-time of visit is stored on the backend in a database.

## Tech Stack used :
Python,
HTML

## How the program works :
Firstly, it asks for signing in.
Secondly, it opens webpage if authorization is successful, otherwise shows a '404 page not found' error.
Thirdly, it takes url input from the viewer and user clicks on 'Shorten' button to proceed.
Fourthly, the shortened url is generated and shown on screen.
Lastly, there is a copy button to copy the url.
